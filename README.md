# AIIP_CNN-GAN-inpainting
AI model to implement a CNN-adversarial network to fill in a missing square inside an image
This is a CY Tech(Cergy, France) students project.
This project re-implements the model (a) in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07379 in figure 9.
The main goal is to be able to fill in a white square inside an image only using the described trained CNN architecture.
